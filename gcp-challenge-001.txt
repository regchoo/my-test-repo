With appropriate preparation, this lab can be completed in 10 mins or less.

Tip #1
check out YT to see how others do it. (especially the Cloud Function portion)

before you click [Start Lab];

TIP #2
- download the suggested image file from "https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/gsp315/map.jpg" to your computer.
  upload this image file to bucket after cloud function has been created

Tip #3
prepare ahead of time the following on a text editor (i suggest using notepad++ for Windows users)
so that you can simply copy and paste to the cloud console during the lab
- a unique bucket name
- a topic name for the pub/sub creation
- a cloud function name
- copy out "index.js" onto your text editor and edit out "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOPIC" with your topic name
  then paste "index.js" back during Cloud Function creation
- you may also copy out "package.json" onto your text editor, although nothing in this file needs to be changed.
